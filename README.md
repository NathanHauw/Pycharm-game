# Turned-Based Game
My first experience with game development, exploring the Pygame framework in the PyCharm IDE</br>

**Turned-Based Game.zip** contains all the necessary assets with the correct file names and hierarchy to run the game.
Meanwhile, **main.py** is the main code for the game, and **img.zip** is a compressed folder for all the used sprites/images in the game
