# Turned-Based Game
My first experience with game development, exploring the Pygame framework in the PyCharm IDE

### Extracting Turned-Based Game.zip will allow to run the whole code with the appropriate file names
Meanwhile, main.py is the main code for the game and img.zip is the compressed image folder for all the used sprites in the game
